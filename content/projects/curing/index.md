In order to build a concrete structure, a negative mould is required in which the viscous substance is poured into. There had been a negative mould for almost every concrete house which most certainly had been built out of wood. curing + junge Römer is a series of concrete sculptures in which Nikolaus Eckhard acts like a builder and arsonist at the same time. After the moulds are constructed, they are set on fire – then the concrete is poured. Pigmented by the soot, the resulting concrete cast bears the imprints of the fire.
