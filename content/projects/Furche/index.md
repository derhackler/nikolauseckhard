The sculpture "Furche" was created during the “Stone Age” workshop. The participants pulled the plow across the field and filled the resulting furrow with concrete. It was excavated and erected that same evening. The event took place at Vienna’s “Welt Teller Feld” which is an experimental agriculture project displaying connections of local eating habits and national and international land (mis)use. Concrete is the second most used material worldwide after water. In Austria, an area of around 550 x 100 meters is sealed every day.
