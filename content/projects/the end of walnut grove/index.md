It is forever night and nobody knows why. Humans hide in caves and pits. Dirt
and darkness are their companions. All they hear is the wind howling across the
frozen wilderness. Joe does not hear the wind, though. He only hears the deafening
rattling noise of his generator which provides light and life. He does not
need to worry about night monsters. He has ample time to look for the solution
to the mystery of eternal darkness. INTEC has something to with it, and he will
find out the rest as well.
